# Assessment of Oro-pharyngeal Cancers by Utilizing Distributary Values like Age, Gender, and Location of the Affected Patients

## Project Overview
This project analyzes oropharyngeal cancer trends using a dataset of 4,500 observaions spanning from 2011 to 2020, sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study examines cancer incidence and mortality based on age, gender, race, and geographical location across 52 U.S. states. Using Tableau, I created a Tableau story to present key insights, helping identify disparities and patterns in cancer prevalence.

## The Data Story
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of oropharyngeal cancer trends, emphasizing critical findings:
- **Age**: Cancer incidence is significantly higher in individuals aged 65+, with 85+ being the most affected group.
- **Gender**: Incidence rates declined for both males and females over time whereas Mortality rates increased for females but remained stable for males.
- **Race**: Non-Hispanic White individuals experience the highest burden of oropharyngeal cancer.
- **Geographical Location**: Minnesota has the highest age-adjusted rate and Florida, Wisconsin, and Delaware show the highest crude rates, emphasizing regional disparities.

These insights underscore the need for targeted cancer screening, public health policies, and resource allocation in high-risk regions.

## Tools used:
- **Tableau Prep** for data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Tableau Desktop** for data visualization

## Repository Structure
- **`Oropharyngeal_Cancer_Analysis.twbx`** - Tableau packaged workbook containing all visualizations
- **`By Age.csv`, `By Area.csv`** - Cleaned datasets using Tableau Prep
- **`Tableau.pptx`** - Presentation summarizing key findings and insights

## How to access the Tableau file
- Download `Oropharyngeal_Cancer_Analysis.twbx` and open it in Tableau Desktop.
- Navigate through the tableau story, interactive dashboard, and visualizations to explore insights.
- Use filters to view cancer trends by age, year, age-adjusted rate and crude rates.
